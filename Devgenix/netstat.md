# The Netstat Command for Windows Operating System Security

Hey there, fellow tech enthusiasts! Today, we're going to talk about a very important tool in the Windows Operating System that can help ensure the security of your computer system. It's called the netstat command.
As we all know, security is a major concern for any computer system, whether it be personal or professional. Windows Operating System, being the most widely used operating system, has a wide range of built-in tools and utilities that can be used to ensure the security of your computer system. One such utility is the netstat command. In this article, we will explore the netstat command and its uses in ensuring the security of your Windows Operating System.

## What is Netstat Command?

The netstat command is a built-in utility in Windows Operating System that displays active network connections (both incoming and outgoing) along with their respective protocol and port number. The command can be used to troubleshoot network issues, monitor network traffic, and identify potential security threats.
In simpler terms, the netstat command is like a secret spy that helps you see what's happening behind the scenes on your computer system. It can show you all the network connections that are currently active, so you can make sure that no one is accessing your computer system without your permission. For example, if you notice that there are a lot of active network connections that you don't recognize, then that could be a sign that someone is accessing your computer system without your permission. By using the netstat command, you can identify these connections and take appropriate actions to prevent any security threats.

Using the netstat command is super easy! The netstat command can be executed from the command prompt, and it comes with various command-line options that can be used to customize the output as per your requirement.
To get started, simply open the command prompt by pressing the Windows key and the R key at the same time, then type in "cmd" and hit enter. This will open up the command prompt.
Once you're in the command prompt, type in ```netstat``` followed by any additional options you want to use. Let's review what you can use Netstat to do.

## Using Netstat Command for Security

The netstat command is a powerful tool that can be used to ensure the security of your Windows Operating System. Here are some of the security-related concepts and features that you can use the netstat command for:

#### 1. Identifying Active Network Connections

The netstat command can be used to identify active network connections on your computer system. This can help you identify any unauthorized network connections that might be running in the background. To view all active network connections, open the command prompt and type the following command:

```
netstat -ano
```

This will display a list of all active network connections along with their respective protocol, local address, foreign address, and state. You can use this information to identify any suspicious connections and take appropriate actions to prevent them from accessing your computer system.

#### 2. Detecting Malware

Malware is a common threat to computer systems, and it can be challenging to detect it using conventional antivirus software. However, the netstat command can be used to detect malware that might be running on your computer system.

Malware typically creates a backdoor connection to the attacker's server, which can be identified using the netstat command. To do this, open the command prompt and type the following command:

```
netstat -ano | findstr "ESTABLISHED"
```

This will display a list of all established network connections on your computer system. If you notice any suspicious connections with an established state, it might be a sign of malware running on your computer system.

#### 3. Identifying Listening Ports

The netstat command can also be used to identify listening ports on your computer system. Listening ports are the ports on your computer system that are open and waiting for incoming network connections. Identifying these ports can help you identify potential security threats and take appropriate actions to prevent them.

To view all listening ports on your computer system, open the command prompt and type the following command:

```
netstat -ano | findstr "LISTENING"
```

This will display a list of all listening ports on your computer system along with their respective process IDs (PID). You can use this information to identify any suspicious processes running on your computer system.

#### 4. Closing Unauthorized Network Connections

If you identify any unauthorized network connections running on your computer system using the netstat command, you can use the command to close them. To do this, open the command prompt and type the following command:

```
netstat -ano | findstr "ESTABLISHED"
```

This will display a list of all established network connections on your computer system along with their respective process IDs (PID). Note down the PID of the suspicious connection that you want to close and type the following command:

```
taskkill /F /PID
```

#### 5. Display the Associated Program

One of the advanced features of the netstat command is the -b option. This option displays the name of the executable or program that is associated with a network connection. This can be especially helpful for identifying potential security threats, as you can see which programs are accessing the network and take appropriate actions if necessary.
To use the -b option, simply type:

```
netstat -b
```
This will display a list of all the active network connections along with the name of the program that is associated with each connection.

#### 6. Display the Process Identifier (PID)

Another advanced feature of the netstat command is the -p option. This option displays the process identifier (PID) of the program that is associated with a network connection. This can be helpful for identifying which programs are using a specific network connection and taking appropriate actions if necessary.

To use the -p option, type: 

```
netstat -p
``` 

This will display a list of all the active network connections along with the PID of the program that is associated with each connection.

## Conclusion

Additionally, it is essential to note that the netstat command is just one tool in your arsenal of security tools for your computer system. It should be used in conjunction with other security tools and best practices to ensure the security of your computer system.

Overall, the netstat command can be a powerful tool for monitoring network connections, identifying potential security threats, and ensuring the security of your Windows Operating System. By using the various command-line options and features of the command, you can ensure the security of your computer system and prevent unauthorized access to your data.
